            <h1> Animation and Motion Graphics </h1>
            <p> The Animation and Motion Graphics program provides students with the fundamentals of two- and threedimensional (2D and 3D) animation, motion graphics, and special effects. Once necessarily hand-made, expensive and rare, animation has undergone a technical transformation and is now a ubiquitous part of special effect, advertising campaigns, video games, movies, and television. </p>

			
            <p> Upon completion of the program requirements, the Associate of Science degree in Animation and Motion Graphics is awarded. Graduates of this program can enter a growing profession or transfer to bachelor-level programs in Animation at Lehman College or other media related programs at senior colleges.
